## MTGA Limited

### Description
A React Web App that allows you to import decks you've built using Wizards of the Coast's MTG Arena application in Limited Draft Environment. It then stores the decks in your profile and analyzes the data for statistics and sharing.

### Technologies
Built with React, SASS, and Firebase.

Uses React-Router and FontAwesome libraries.

Calls the Scryfall API.

### Learning Lessons
This was my first full-fledged app using React. I also decided not to use a CSS framework to bolster my strength with CSS and learn more about SASS.

My biggest challenge in this project was due to the Asynchronous nature of calling the Scryfall API and also using Firebase Authentication which cause multiple problems when try to set and pull state from components.
